# to-do
today I just realised that there is a limit on how many
webhooks there could be in a channel, because of this, 
I need to handle such error of a channel ever reaches 10 webhooks.

## to handle this 
- delete a webhook in a channel if the limit is met.
- limit max webhook by this bot to 1.
- hope it works.
